# Complete RAG Implementation

This repository contains a complete implementation of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot using **LangChain** and **ChromaDB**. The chatbot integrates cutting-edge technologies to deliver highly contextual and relevant responses based on a provided knowledge base.

---

## Features

- **Embedding with Hugging Face API**: Uses state-of-the-art models to generate embeddings for knowledge documents, ensuring accurate retrieval of relevant context.
- **ChromaDB as Vector Database**: Efficiently stores and queries document embeddings to enable fast and precise context retrieval.
- **Response Generation with Google AI Studio**: Generates human-like and context-aware responses using advanced AI models.
- **Seamless Query Relevance Check**: Incorporates logic to ensure queries are relevant to the knowledge base, enhancing response accuracy.

---

## Architecture

1. **Query Processing**:
   - User inputs a query.
   - Top relevant documents are retrieved using embeddings stored in ChromaDB.

2. **Prompt Construction**:
   - Context is extracted from retrieved documents.
   - A structured prompt is created and sent to the response generation model.

3. **Response Generation**:
   - Google AI Studio processes the prompt and generates a response.
   - The response is streamed or displayed to the user.

4. **Source Highlighting**:
   - Provides sources used to generate the response for transparency.
