# AR's Influence on Consumer Behavior: Potential and Pitfalls

Sources investigate the effects of Augmented Reality on consumer behavior, from developing the shopping experience to more challenges entailed in increasing complexity and ease of use. Although AR brings some innovative ways of interaction with the consumer in order to provide information, effectiveness is lower than the other, much more common influences, such as FOP labels.

## Improving Food Choices Using Augmented Reality

A number of studies demonstrate the potential of AR to encourage healthier food choices. A study [9] explored the feasibility of an AR application which gives users personalized suggestions of healthy products to purchase in supermarkets. The application identified shelf products and overlaid color-coded flags, thus allowing users to point out healthy foods quickly along with bad ones to avoid. Another app [1] aimed to guide consumers toward making healthier selections focusing on diet. It relied on the color-coded classification between healthy and unhealthy foods.

Source [11] would propose an AR application, PHARA, to aid in grocery store food product choice decision-making. The application of AR is applied to represent information about food products to a user. Another study [1] uses a mobile application-based AR, which provides information to consumers on products using AR and suggests healthy and similar products to people. 

Furthermore, researchers [12] conducted four studies to investigate the influence of a food scanner app (Yuka) on consumer choice. They found that, whereas the app increased intentions to buy healthier products in hypothetical situations, it had no impact on real behavior in the grocery store itself during an experimental supermarket setting. This gap between intentions and actual choices also points to the effort which may be required to utilize it while shopping, thus constituting a barrier toward the effectiveness of the application of the app.

## AR vs Conventional Techniques

All these sources point out that in almost all conditions, consumer behavior affects AR interventions less compared to the traditional methods such as FOP labeling. A comparative study [7] where a head-to-head comparison of the app on the food scanner versus FOP labeling came out indicated that in all situations, FOP labeling always outscored the application.

### Reasons for Differences in Performance:
There are several reasons that can explain differences in performance. FOPs give consumers a look from the front of the package nutrition information directly accessible and easy to process. With AR applications, especially if they require scanning the barcode, their use will require more effort from the userâ€”which may interfere with the proper processing of the information or even reduce the making of an informed choice. 

Source [13] concludes that food scanner apps are ineffective as substitutes for FOP labels since the information is far more extensive and multiple scans are required for comparison of packaged products. Such multilevel processing of information might, in turn, sub-optimally affect consumers' choices.

## Potential Applications and Future Directions

Sources admit that, despite the problems in AR, it has uses and future directions.

- AR can be used to create interactive menus in restaurants so that customers can view three-dimensional visualizations of the dishes and the lists of ingredients in detail [4]. It may enhance customer engagement and possibly your customer choice. 
- AR can be embedded in food packaging so that consumers get a rich interaction experience [4]. Scanning the packaging shall unlock for users information regarding the nutritional data, the origin, and the process of manufacture along with virtual representations of the food. Such enhanced transparency and engagement might impact the purchasing decision. 
- AR applications can be further developed to aid in new food product development [4]. Developers can easily identify possible problems and then optimize a product for actual production by virtue of virtualization of the product followed by its analysis in real environments or simulated environments. 
- Further studies may be conducted to ascertain whether AR with other modes like FOP labels push consumers toward healthier diets [14]. Perhaps, in isolation, the strategy can do little but when merged, the constraints are crossed, and intervention becomes that much stronger. All levelled off, taken broadly, in a rather convex shape to reveal the impact of AR on consumer behavior. Promises of AR about enhancing shopping experiences and healthy choices seem alluringly good but simplifying complexity and ease of use seem the biggest hurdles. Further research and development of optimal applications are required in their realization as regards their potential in shaping consumer behavior.
