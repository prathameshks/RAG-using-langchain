        <h1>Ingredient Substitutions and FoodKG</h1>
        <p>A comprehensive approach to ingredient substitutions and healthy alternatives using FoodKG and DIISH
            heuristic.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Ingredient Substitutions</h2>
        <p>Source [10] has examined all possible identification directions and the suggestion of ingredient
            alternatives. FoodKG is described as a knowledge graph that allows ranking the most plausible alternatives
            for explicit semantic information, as well as the implicit semantics captured by word embeddings, leading
            users toward healthy choices based on dietary requirements and preferences.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>FoodKG: A Food Knowledge Graph</h2>
        <p>FoodKG is a knowledge graph of recipes and their ingredients, sourced from various references:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Food Category:</strong> FoodKG utilizes knowledge from the FoodOn ontology to classify
                ingredients.</li>
            <li><strong>Nutritional Content:</strong> FoodKG associates ingredients with USDA data, offering detailed
                nutritional information (calories, macronutrients, and micronutrients).</li>
            <li><strong>Recipes:</strong> FoodKG includes various recipes, enabling analysis of ingredient occurrences
                and recipe contexts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Figure 4 and reference [15] show how FoodKG links ingredient information with FoodOn ontology and USDA
            nutritional data:</p>

        <h2>Naming Target Ingredients and Healthy Alternatives</h2>
        <p>FoodKG helps identify ingredients to replace based on dietary restrictions. The system considers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ingredient Type Restrictions:</strong> Based on FoodOn’s class hierarchy, it automatically
                infers proscribed ingredients (e.g., meat for vegetarians).</li>
            <li><strong>Nutritional Content Constraints:</strong> The app computes the nutritional content using USDA
                data to highlight ingredients contributing to restricted nutrients.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Ranking Possible Substitutions: The DIISH Heuristic</h2>
        <p>Source [8] introduces the Diet-Improvement Ingredient Substitutability Heuristic (DIISH), which combines
            explicit and implicit semantics using word embeddings like Word2Vec and spaCy. DIISH uses four scoring
            metrics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Co-occurrence Similarity:</strong> Measures the co-occurrence of ingredients in recipes.</li>
            <li><strong>Recipe Context Similarity:</strong> Captures the similarity in recipe contexts between the
                target ingredient and potential substitutes using PPMI.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These scores are combined into a ranking formula that suggests meaningful ingredient substitutes, excluding
            ingredients that are superclasses or subclasses of the target.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Evaluation and Sample Results</h2>
        <p>DIISH’s effectiveness was tested using three datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to
            baselines. The following table shows some substitution examples:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Target Ingredient</th>
                    <th>Ground-Truth Substitutes</th>
                    <th>DIISH's Top 5 Ranked Substitutes</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Arugula</td>
                    <td>Watercress, Belgian endive, Radicchio, Escarole</td>
                    <td>Watercress, Frisee, Radicchio, Romaine lettuce, Butter lettuce</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Lard</td>
                    <td>Vegetable oil, Shortening, Margarine, Bacon fat</td>
                    <td>Vegetable shortening, Shortening, Margarine, Bacon fat, Butter</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </section>

        <h2>Example Use Case: Diabetic Patient</h2>
        <p>Source [15] demonstrates the application of DIISH for a diabetic patient seeking to reduce carbohydrate
            intake. The system suggests healthier substitutes for potatoes:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Ranked Substitutes</th>
                    <th>Carbohydrates per 100g</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Turnip</td>
                    <td>6.4g</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Squash</td>
                    <td>6.9g</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Cauliflower</td>
                    <td>5.0g</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Butternut squash</td>
                    <td>11.7g</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Zucchini</td>
                    <td>3.1g</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Custom Databases and Local Food Products</h2>
        <p>In addition to FoodKG, custom databases tailored for local food products have been developed, such as a
            mobile app that combines barcode scanning with OCR technology to identify food ingredients and provide
            health advice. This app supplements information from open-source databases like Open Food Facts [17].</p>
